The k-Median Problem is a clustering problem where the goal is to select k points (medians) from a given set of points to minimize the sum of distances
between each point and its nearest median. Here's an outline of a randomized algorithm for the k-Median Problem:

1. Initialize k medians: Select k random points from the given set of points as initial medians.

2. Assign points to medians: For each point, assign it to the nearest median based on the distance metric used (e.g., Euclidean distance).

3. Update medians: Update each median by setting it to the centroid of the points assigned to it.

4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until convergence or a maximum number of iterations.

5. Return the final medians and the corresponding cost (sum of distances).

The expected running time of the randomized algorithm for the k-Median Problem depends on the number of iterations and the time complexity of assigning points 
to medians and updating medians.

Assigning points to medians can be done in O(nk) time, where n is the number of points and k is the number of medians.

Updating medians involves calculating the centroid of points assigned to each median, which can be done in O(n) time.

The number of iterations required for convergence depends on the data and the problem instance. In the worst case, the algorithm may require a large number of 
iterations to converge, leading to a higher running time. However, in practice, the algorithm often converges quickly.

The approximation ratio of the randomized algorithm for the k-Median Problem is known to be at most O(log n), where n is the number of points. This means that the
cost of the solution produced by the randomized algorithm is at most O(log n) times the cost of the optimal solution.

It's important to note that the performance of the randomized algorithm can vary depending on the data and the problem instance. Analyzing the expected running 
time and approximation ratio provides a theoretical understanding of the algorithm's behavior but may not reflect its performance in every scenario. Evaluating 
the algorithm on a set of benchmark instances can provide practical insights into its effectiveness and efficiency.
