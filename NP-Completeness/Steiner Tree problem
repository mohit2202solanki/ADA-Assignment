The Steiner Tree Problem is an NP-hard problem, meaning that there is no known polynomial-time algorithm to solve it exactly. 
However, we can use approximation algorithms to find solutions that are guaranteed to be within a certain factor of the optimal solution.

One popular approximation algorithm for the Steiner Tree Problem is the Nearest Neighbor Algorithm. The algorithm works as follows:

1. Select an arbitrary vertex as the initial vertex.
2. Repeat until all terminals are connected:
   a. Find the nearest terminal to the current set of connected vertices.
   b. Add the nearest terminal and the corresponding edge to the solution.
   c. Add the nearest terminal to the set of connected vertices.
3. Return the resulting tree as the approximate Steiner tree.

The approximation ratio of the Nearest Neighbor Algorithm is known to be at most 2. In other words, the cost of the approximate Steiner
tree found by the algorithm is guaranteed to be at most twice the cost of the optimal Steiner tree.

The running time complexity of the Nearest Neighbor Algorithm depends on the number of vertices and edges in the graph, as well as the number of 
terminals. Let's denote n as the number of vertices, m as the number of edges, and t as the number of terminals.

The main part of the algorithm is the repeated selection of the nearest terminal, which requires O(t) time in each iteration. Since there are t terminals
and the algorithm connects each terminal exactly once, the total running time for this part is O(t^2).

Additionally, the algorithm may need to check the distance between each pair of vertices to find the nearest terminal, which can be done in O(n^2) time. 
Therefore, the overall running time complexity of the Nearest Neighbor Algorithm is O(t^2 + n^2).

It's important to note that the Nearest Neighbor Algorithm is a simple and efficient approximation algorithm for the Steiner Tree Problem, but 
it may not always produce the best possible approximation. There are other more sophisticated algorithms with improved approximation ratios, such as the
Christofides' algorithm, but they typically have higher running time complexities. The choice of algorithm depends on the specific requirements of the problem
instance and the trade-off between running time and approximation quality.
