The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is an NP-hard problem, and a brute force algorithm for finding the optimal solution involves trying all 
possible permutations of the cities. Here's an implementation of a brute force algorithm for the TSP in Python:

python
import itertools

def calculate_distance(city1, city2):
    # Calculate the distance between two cities
    # This function can be customized based on the problem's distance metric
    return distance

def calculate_tour_distance(tour):
    # Calculate the total distance of a tour
    total_distance = 0
    for i in range(len(tour) - 1):
        total_distance += calculate_distance(tour[i], tour[i + 1])
    return total_distance

def brute_force_tsp(cities):
    # Generate all possible permutations of the cities
    all_tours = list(itertools.permutations(cities))

    # Initialize the best tour and its distance
    best_tour = None
    best_distance = float('inf')

    # Iterate through all tours and find the one with the minimum distance
    for tour in all_tours:
        tour_distance = calculate_tour_distance(tour)
        if tour_distance < best_distance:
            best_tour = tour
            best_distance = tour_distance

    return best_tour, best_distance

# Example usage
cities = [(0, 0), (1, 1), (2, 3), (4, 1), (2, 2)]
best_tour, best_distance = brute_force_tsp(cities)
print("Best Tour:", best_tour)
print("Best Distance:", best_distance)
```

In this code, the `calculate_distance` function calculates the distance between two cities. The `calculate_tour_distance` function calculates the 
total distance of a given tour by summing the distances between consecutive cities. The `brute_force_tsp` function generates all possible permutations
of the cities and iterates through them to find the tour with the minimum distance.

The time complexity of the brute force algorithm for the TSP can be analyzed using Big-O notation. Let n be the number of cities.

The number of possible permutations of n cities is n!, which grows factorially with the number of cities. Therefore, generating all possible tours takes
O(n!) time.

For each tour, calculating the total distance requires visiting all cities once, resulting in O(n) operations. Since there are n! tours to consider, the 
overall time complexity of calculating the distances for all tours is O(n * n!).

Hence, the total time complexity of the brute force algorithm for the TSP is O(n * n!). The algorithm becomes computationally expensive as the number of cities
increases since the factorial growth makes the search space grow very quickly. Therefore, the brute force algorithm is only feasible for small problem instances.
For larger instances, more efficient approximation algorithms or heuristics are used to find near-optimal solutions.
