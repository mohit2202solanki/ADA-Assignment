The Set Cover Problem is an NP-complete problem that involves finding the minimum number of sets (from a given collection of sets) needed to cover all elements
in a universe set. One well-known approximation algorithm for the Set Cover Problem is the Greedy Approximation Algorithm. Here's how it works:

1. Start with an empty solution set that initially covers no elements.
2. Repeat until all elements in the universe set are covered:
   a. Select the set that covers the maximum number of uncovered elements.
   b. Add this set to the solution set.
   c. Remove the covered elements from the universe set.
3. Return the solution set.

The Greedy Approximation Algorithm has a guaranteed approximation ratio of ln(n), where n is the number of elements in the universe set. This means that the 
solution produced by the algorithm is at most ln(n) times the size of the optimal solution.

The running time complexity of the Greedy Approximation Algorithm depends on the number of sets and the number of elements in the universe set. Let m be the
number of sets and n be the number of elements. The algorithm requires iterating through all sets and checking their elements. Hence, the worst-case time complexity
is O(m * n).

To further optimize the running time, you can use data structures such as hash tables or bitsets to efficiently track covered elements and determine the set that 
covers the maximum number of uncovered elements. This can potentially reduce the running time to O(m * n / w), where w is the average number of elements covered by
a set.

Keep in mind that the Greedy Approximation Algorithm provides a near-optimal solution but may not always produce the optimal solution. However, it is widely used 
in practice due to its simplicity and reasonable approximation guarantees.
