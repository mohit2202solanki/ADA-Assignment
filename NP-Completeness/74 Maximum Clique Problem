The Maximum Clique Problem is an NP-hard problem, and finding an exact solution for large instances can be computationally expensive. Heuristic 
algorithms provide a practical approach to finding approximate solutions efficiently. One such heuristic algorithm is the Iterated Local Search (ILS) algorithm. 

The ILS algorithm is an iterative algorithm that combines a local search procedure with a perturbation mechanism. It starts with an initial solution and 
iteratively improves it by performing local search and perturbing the solution. Here's an implementation of the ILS algorithm for the Maximum Clique Problem 
in Python:

import random

def generate_initial_solution(graph):
    # Generate an initial solution by randomly selecting vertices
    vertices = list(graph.keys())
    initial_solution = []
    for vertex in vertices:
        if all(vertex not in graph[v] for v in initial_solution):
            initial_solution.append(vertex)
    return initial_solution

def local_search(graph, solution):
    # Perform local search to improve the solution
    improved = True
    while improved:
        improved = False
        for vertex in solution.copy():
            neighbors = [v for v in solution if v in graph[vertex]]
            if len(neighbors) > len(solution):
                solution = neighbors
                improved = True
    return solution

def perturbation(solution):
    # Perturb the solution by removing a random vertex
    if len(solution) > 0:
        random_vertex = random.choice(solution)
        solution.remove(random_vertex)
    return solution

def iterated_local_search(graph, iterations):
    best_solution = []
    best_size = 0

    for _ in range(iterations):
        # Generate an initial solution
        solution = generate_initial_solution(graph)

        # Perform local search
        solution = local_search(graph, solution)

        # Update the best solution if necessary
        if len(solution) > best_size:
            best_solution = solution
            best_size = len(solution)

        # Perturb the solution
        solution = perturbation(solution)

    return best_solution

# Example usage
graph = {
    'A': ['B', 'C', 'D'],
    'B': ['A', 'C'],
    'C': ['A', 'B', 'D', 'E'],
    'D': ['A', 'C', 'E'],
    'E': ['C', 'D']
}

exact_solution = ['A', 'C', 'D']
heuristic_solution = iterated_local_search(graph, iterations=100)

print("Exact Solution:", exact_solution)
print("Heuristic Solution:", heuristic_solution)
```

In this code, the `generate_initial_solution` function generates an initial solution by randomly selecting vertices that are not adjacent to each other.
The `local_search` function performs a local search procedure to improve the solution by iteratively removing vertices that have more neighbors within the 
solution. The `perturbation` function perturbs the solution by randomly removing a vertex. The `iterated_local_search` function performs the main iteration
loop, generating initial solutions, performing local search, and perturbing the solutions. It keeps track of the best solution found throughout the iterations.

To compare the performance of the heuristic algorithm to the exact algorithm on benchmark instances, you would need a collection of benchmark graphs and their
corresponding maximum cliques (if available). You can run the exact algorithm (such as the Bron-Kerbosch algorithm) and the heuristic algorithm (iterated local
search) on each benchmark instance and compare the sizes of the maximum cliques found. You can also measure the running time of each algorithm to evaluate their 
efficiency. Keep in mind that the exact algorithm guarantees an optimal solution but may be computationally expensive for large instances, while the heuristic
algorithm provides an approximate solution efficiently.
