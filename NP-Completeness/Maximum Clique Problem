The Maximum Clique Problem is an NP-hard problem, and finding an exact solution for large instances can be computationally expensive. Heuristic 
algorithms provide a practical approach to finding approximate solutions efficiently. One such heuristic algorithm is the Bron-Kerbosch algorithm.

The Bron-Kerbosch algorithm is a recursive algorithm that explores the clique space of a graph. It starts with an empty clique and iteratively 
expands it by adding vertices that are adjacent to all vertices in the current clique. Here's an implementation of the Bron-Kerbosch algorithm in Python:

def bron_kerbosch(graph, clique, candidates, excluded):
    if not candidates and not excluded:
        return clique

    max_clique = clique.copy()

    for vertex in candidates.copy():
        new_clique = clique.copy()
        new_clique.append(vertex)

        new_candidates = [v for v in candidates if v in graph[vertex]]
        new_excluded = [v for v in excluded if v in graph[vertex]]

        new_max_clique = bron_kerbosch(graph, new_clique, new_candidates, new_excluded)

        if len(new_max_clique) > len(max_clique):
            max_clique = new_max_clique

        candidates.remove(vertex)
        excluded.append(vertex)

    return max_clique

def find_maximum_clique(graph):
    vertices = list(graph.keys())
    clique = []
    candidates = vertices
    excluded = []

    maximum_clique = bron_kerbosch(graph, clique, candidates, excluded)

    return maximum_clique

# Example usage
graph = {
    'A': ['B', 'C'],
    'B': ['A', 'C', 'D'],
    'C': ['A', 'B', 'D'],
    'D': ['B', 'C', 'E'],
    'E': ['D']
}

maximum_clique = find_maximum_clique(graph)
print("Maximum Clique:", maximum_clique)


In this code, the bron_kerbosch function implements the Bron-Kerbosch algorithm recursively. It takes a graph, a current clique, a set of candidate 
vertices, and a set of excluded vertices. It explores all possible cliques by adding one vertex at a time and recursively calling itself.

The find_maximum_clique function initializes the necessary data structures and calls the bron_kerbosch function to find the maximum clique in the given graph.

To compare the performance of the heuristic algorithm to the exact algorithm on benchmark instances, you would need a collection of benchmark graphs and t
heir corresponding maximum cliques (if available). You can run the heuristic algorithm and the exact algorithm (such as a backtracking-based algorithm) on
each benchmark instance and compare the sizes of the maximum cliques found. You can also measure the running time of each algorithm to evaluate their efficiency. 
Keep in mind that the exact algorithm may not be feasible for large instances, while the heuristic algorithm provides a good trade-off between solution quality 
and running time.
