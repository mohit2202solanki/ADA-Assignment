Implementing a simulated annealing algorithm for the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) involves defining the state representation, the objective function,
and the cooling schedule. Here's an outline of the algorithm:

1. Define the initial state: Generate an initial solution by randomly permuting the cities or using a heuristic such as the nearest neighbor algorithm.

2. Define the objective function: Calculate the total distance or cost of the current solution. The objective is to minimize this distance.

3. Define the cooling schedule: Simulated annealing uses a cooling schedule that gradually decreases the temperature over iterations. The temperature controls 
the likelihood of accepting worse solutions. A common cooling schedule is to decrease the temperature exponentially, such as T = T_0 * alpha^k, where T_0 is the
initial temperature, alpha is the cooling rate (0 < alpha < 1), and k is the current iteration.

4. Perform iterations: Repeat the following steps until the stopping condition is met.
   a. Generate a new neighbor solution by applying a random modification to the current solution, such as swapping two cities or reversing a subsequence of cities.
   b. Calculate the objective function value for the new solution.
   c. If the new solution is better (i.e., has a lower distance), accept it as the current solution.
   d. If the new solution is worse, calculate the acceptance probability using the Metropolis criterion: P = exp((current_distance - new_distance) / temperature).
   Accept the new solution with probability P. Otherwise, reject the new solution.
   e. Update the temperature according to the cooling schedule.

5. Return the best solution found during the iterations.

Here's a Python implementation of the simulated annealing algorithm for the TSP:

```python
import random
import math

def tsp_simulated_annealing(cities, temperature, cooling_rate):
    num_cities = len(cities)
    current_solution = random.sample(cities, num_cities)  # Random initial solution
    best_solution = current_solution[:]
    current_distance = calculate_distance(current_solution)
    best_distance = current_distance

    while temperature > 0.1:
        new_solution = current_solution[:]
        # Apply a random modification to generate a new neighbor solution
        # (e.g., swap two cities)
        i, j = random.sample(range(num_cities), 2)
        new_solution[i], new_solution[j] = new_solution[j], new_solution[i]

        new_distance = calculate_distance(new_solution)
        delta_distance = new_distance - current_distance

        if delta_distance < 0 or math.exp(-delta_distance / temperature) > random.random():
            current_solution = new_solution
            current_distance = new_distance

            if new_distance < best_distance:
                best_solution = new_solution
                best_distance = new_distance

        temperature *= cooling_rate

    return best_solution, best_distance

def calculate_distance(solution):
    distance = 0
    num_cities = len(solution)
    for i in range(num_cities):
        distance += distance_between(solution[i], solution[(i + 1) % num_cities])
    return distance

def distance_between(city1, city2):
    # Calculate the distance between two cities
    # (e.g., using Euclidean distance)
    return math.sqrt((city1[0] - city2[0]) ** 2 + (city1[1] - city2[1]) ** 2)

# Example usage
cities = [(0, 0), (1, 2), (3, 1), (4, 3), (5, 2)]
initial_temperature = 1000
cooling_rate = 0.99

best_solution, best_distance = tsp_simulated
