The Subset Sum Problem is an NP-complete problem that involves finding a subset of a given set of integers whose sum equals a target value.
A randomized algorithm for the Subset Sum Problem is the Randomized Approximation Algorithm. Here's an implementation of the algorithm in Python:

import random

def randomized_subset_sum(numbers, target):
    subset = []
    current_sum = 0

    # Randomly select numbers and add them to the subset until the sum exceeds the target
    while current_sum < target:
        number = random.choice(numbers)
        if current_sum + number <= target:
            subset.append(number)
            current_sum += number

    return subset

# Example usage
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
target = 15

subset = randomized_subset_sum(numbers, target)
print("Subset:", subset)

In this code, the `randomized_subset_sum` function takes a list of numbers and a target value as input. It iteratively selects numbers randomly from the
list and adds them to the subset until the sum of the subset exceeds the target value. The algorithm does not guarantee an optimal solution but provides an
approximate solution efficiently.

To analyze the expected running time of the randomized algorithm for the Subset Sum Problem, we can use probabilistic techniques. The running time depends 
on the number of iterations needed to find a subset whose sum exceeds the target value.

Let's assume the input set contains n numbers. For each iteration, we randomly select a number from the set, which can be done in O(1) time. Therefore,
the time complexity of each iteration is O(1).

The probability of selecting a number that increases the current sum towards the target is p = k / n, where k is the number of numbers in the set whose sum 
is less than the target. The probability of not selecting such a number is q = 1 - p.

The expected number of iterations needed to find a subset whose sum exceeds the target value can be calculated as follows:

E(X) = 1/p = n/k

Therefore, the expected running time of the randomized algorithm can be approximated by O(n/k), where k is the number of numbers in the set whose sum is less 
than the target value.

It's important to note that the actual running time may vary depending on the specific distribution of numbers in the set and the target value. In some cases, 
the algorithm may find a suitable subset quickly, while in other cases, it may take longer to find a suitable subset.
